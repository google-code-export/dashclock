<h1>About DashClock</h1>

DashClock is a replacement lock screen clock widget for Android 4.2+. It also exposes additional status items called extensions. The widget comes bundled with extensions that give you instant access to:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Your current local weather<br>
</li><li>Missed calls and unread text messages<br>
</li><li>Your next calendar appointment<br>
</li><li>Unread Gmail inbox or priority inbox conversations<br>
</li><li>Your next scheduled alarm</li></ul>

To add the widget to your Android 4.2 device's lock screen, simply swipe to the left-most page of your lock screen and touch the "+" icon. Then, select "DashClock" to customize and add the widget. You can make this the primary lock screen widget, replacing the default clock, by first touching-and-holding it and then dragging it horizontally to the very rightmost position.<br>
